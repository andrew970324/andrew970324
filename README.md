## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew Wang! 
I'm a first year MS in Business Analytics student at UCLA Anderson. I believe data has the potential to transform the way we think and interact as a society. As an analyst, I strive to bridge the gap between the business and technical side of analytics while cultivating beneficial two-way relationships between companies and their customers.

Below is a summary of my skills:
- SQL (MySQL, SQLite)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, Keras, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- R
- SPSS
- Microsoft Excel
- Microsoft PPT

Aside from data analytics, you can find me reading non-fiction books, watching basketball, and playing video games in my free time. Please feel free to connect and reach out to me at any time! I love discussing all things data-related as well as hobbies/interests.
