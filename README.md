## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew Wang 
I'm currently pursuing an MS in Business Analytics at UCLA Anderson and working at Paramount Pictures on the Data Science team. I believe data has the potential to transform the way we think and make decisions as a society. In my professional work, I strive to use data storytelling as a way to help organizations build brand equity and cultivate meaningful relationships with their customers.

My skillset includes:
- Languages: SQL (MySQL), Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Gurobi), R (ggplot2, RMD)
- Software: Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, GitHub, Excel, PowerPoint, Tableau, Snowflake, AWS, GCP

Aside from my work, you can find me reading non-fiction books, watching basketball, and playing video games in my free time. Please feel free to connect and reach out to me at any time! I love discussing all things data-related as well as hobbies/interests.
